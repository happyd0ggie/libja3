* libja3 -- WORK IN PROGRESS!
~libja3~ is a C implementation of J. Althouse's method for profiling SSL/TLS Clients called [[https://github.com/salesforce/ja3][JA3]]. This project aims at providing a C-library for the JA3-algorithm and a fast and easy to use CLI tool, called ~ja3sum~, which takes a .pcap- or .pcapng-file to extract all JA3-TLS-fingerprints for further processing.
